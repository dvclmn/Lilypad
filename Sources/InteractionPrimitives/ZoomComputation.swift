///
/// The mapping uses a user-facing sensitivity on a 0...1 scale:
/// - 0 = not sensitive,
/// - 1 = highly sensitive.
///
/// The factor is computed as:
/// factor = 1 + contribution * perPoint
/// where perPoint = sensitivity * maxPerPoint.
///
/// Choose weights to control how horizontal and vertical movement contribute:
/// - `.upRight`: right (+x) and up (-y) increase zoom; left and down decrease.
/// - `.vertical`: down (+y) increases zoom; up decreases (matches existing swipe behavior).
